# The idea

I have often found myself lacking a smooth way to listen to a continuous stream of recorded language sentences.

On top of that, I strongly like the shadowing technique used for instance by Pimsleur in their language courses, where you first hear the sentence in english, and then get a few seconds to repeat, before it is played in the learned language.

Here, the aim is to make this for myself, to allow uploading and record sentences, and perhaps on top of that, use web APIs to synthesize speech on the fly.

# The technology

* React-native building initially to Android
